# FT_Exceptions
Error Handling and Exceptions in FileMaker.

Bookmark or watch the repo, there will be added more in the next days. 

The two custom functions are just examples. We are currently rewriting them to make use of the while() function. Also it is planned to use json for the Exception object. 

#### What does 'FT' stand for? 

All our **FileMaker**-based projects and products are prefixed with an **F** and the **T** is for **technology, tipps&tricks, techniques** or open **templates** for the community. These files are basically examples and demonstrations where you can copy stuff from and include it your individual apps and solutions.
